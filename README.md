Feature engineering and exploratory analysis of logistics trip data to extract insights, identify bottlenecks, and prepare a clean, training-ready dataset for predictive modeling
#  Logistics Case Study: Feature Engineering & Training-Ready Data  
**End-to-end analysis of logistics trip data — cleaning, feature engineering, and insights extraction — leading to a structured, training-ready dataset for predictive modeling.**

##  Project Overview  
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation** – Removed redundant identifiers, handled dwell time anomalies, and structured trip-level data for consistency.  
- **Feature Engineering** – Created meaningful features (e.g., hub dwell times, trip timing, route characteristics) for predictive modeling.  
- **Exploratory Analysis** – Identified demand hubs, seasonal spikes, and operational bottlenecks across source/destination centers.  
- **Training-Ready Dataset** – Final dataset curated with key features (time, distance, hub handling, trip schedule) for building an ETA prediction model.
